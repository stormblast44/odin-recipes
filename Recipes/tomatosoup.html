    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Homemade tomato soup is made with tomatoes, onions, basil and just a few other ingredients. It’s so easy to make, you can forget about the store-bought stuff. This classic tomato soup recipe is restaurant quality! Because this is a homemade tomato soup made with canned tomatoes, it can be enjoyed anytime of the year. There’s no need to worry about the soup having a “canned” taste. We provide you with 2 optional ingredients to get rid of the canned tomato flavor. </p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons (30 g) butter</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons (30 g) olive oil</li>
        <li>1 small onion (chopped)</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic (minced)</li>
        <li>2 leaves basil (chopped)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground cinnamon (optional: helps mask the "canned" taste)</li>
        <li>2 cups (480 g) chicken stock (vegetable stock or water)</li>
        <li>1 (28 oz.) can whole peeled tomatoes (San Marzano or plum tomatoes)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons uncooked white rice (optional: helps thicken soup)</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon baking soda (optional: cuts acidity in tomatoes)</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Garnishes</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>homemade croutons </li>
    </ul>
<h4>Preparation Instructions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt the olive oil and butter over medium heat in a saucepan. Add the onions and saute for 10 minutes or until they are softened and translucent. Add the minced garlic, basil, salt, black pepper, red pepper flakes and cinnamon and cook while stirring for 1 additional minute.</li>
        <li>Carefully stir in the canned tomatoes, rice and chicken stock. Cover the pot and lower the heat to a simmer for 20-25 minutes. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li>Add the baking soda and stir. The soup will fizz and bubble which will subside quickly.</li>
        <li>Use an immersion blender to puree the ingredients until smooth. The soup can also be carefully poured into a stand blender to puree and transferred back into the pan to keep warm. Serve immediately topped with croutons and shredded cheese.</li>
