    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Sushi rolls are a crowd favourite! Especially when they’re filled with good quality seafood and fresh vegetables. Our recipe feeds roughly 2 people, and you’ll need a sushi mat. Adjust ingredient portions accordingly – and feel free to personalise your sushi rolls with additional ingredients!</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>4 sheets nori</li>
        <li>1 cup sushi rice rinsed</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon seasoned rice vinegar</li>
        <li>1/2 cucumber cut into thin strips</li>
        <li>110 g fresh sushi-grade red salmon</li>
        <li>1 medium carrot grated</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
    </ul>
<h4>Preparation Instructions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>In a saucepan on high heat, place sushi rice into 1 ½ cups of water. Cover the saucepan and bring it to a boil before reducing the heat to low and cooking until rice is soft and has absorbed the water. Remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Combine cooked rice with vinegar in a bowl and stir to prevent rice from becoming clumpy.</li>
        <li>Place 1 nori sheet on a sushi mat with the shiny-side facing down. Spread a quarter of the rice mixture over the nori sheet and make sure you leave a border that’s roughly 3cm wide along the edges.</li>
        <li>Place one-quarter of the avocado along the edge facing you. Top with one quarter each of the salmon, cucumber and carrot.</li>
        <li>Using the sushi mat, roll up the filling and repeat with remaining ingredients.</li>
        <li>Slice each roll into bite-sized pieces. Serve with soy sauce.</li>
    </ol>
